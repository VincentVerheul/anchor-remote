        <h4 class="text-info">Purpose</h4>
        <p> This application provides an anchor remote control via your mobile phone.
            The application runs on a Raspberri Pi miniature computer which is connected
            to your anchor windlass.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-info">Version</h4>
        <p> This version ({{ version }}) assumes that you do not have a chain counter
            installed in your windlass. The actual chain length is therefore
            estimated, based on the number of seconds that the anchor down / up
            actions were executed. Set the down / up speeds via the boat settings.
